 
 this repo contains answers to the following questions.

 Problem description: You will investigate various search algorithms for the graph in Figure 1. Edges are labeled with their costs, and heuristic values h for states are labeled next to the states. S is the start state, and G is the goal state. 
Tasks to do
1.	Read about the general operation of the following search strategies for both tree search and graph search 
 
a.	Depth first search
b.	Breadth First Search
c.	Uniform cost search
d.	Greedy search
e.	A* search 
f.	
2.	Using sets and dictionary libraries represent the graph in Figure 1 into a python graph structure.
3.	Using python implement the following search strategies using for tree search
